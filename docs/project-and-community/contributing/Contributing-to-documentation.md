We welcome contributors to the joola.io documentation with open arms - just as we welcome contributors to the joola.io codebase!

Our main store of documentation is this wiki site.

## 1. Contributing to the wiki

To make edits to the wiki, fork the repo (git://github.com/joola/joola.io.wiki.git), make edits and then submit a pull request.
The wiki is powered by [Gollum] [gollum]: to date the best documentation we've found on using Gollum (particularly embedding code, generating sidebars etc.) is from the [Gollum Readme][gollum-readme].

All the wiki documentation is stored in Markdown format. Good tools for editing markdown include [Markdownpad] (http://markdownpad.com/) on Windows, or [Mou] (http://mouapp.com/) for Mac.
We also like [Sublime Text] (http://www.sublimetext.com/).
