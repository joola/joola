joola is an extensive framework with many facets and capabilities. To highlight all of these capabilities and as part of the Professional Services carried by [joo.la][joo.la] we have compiled the following publicly available workshops.

Each workshop has the following structure:
- The goal of the workshop
- Who is the suitable audience
- Setup needed to carry out the workshop
- Audience pre-requisites
- Suggested schedule
- The workshop contents itself
In addition, workshops are accompanied by an online presentation and a [matching lab](labs). 

The following workshops are available:
- [[Introduction to joola]]
- [[Data Modeling and Management]]
- [[Developing with joola]]
- [[System and Security]]
- [[QA and Testing]]

#### Guided Workshops
If you prefer, we can arrange for an online/on-site workshop to be delivered for your engineers.
