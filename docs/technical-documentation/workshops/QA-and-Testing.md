### Goal
Train QA and Testing engineers on relevant aspects of joola, specifically:
- Understand the system on all of its components and workflows.
- Understand the organization's specific data mapping and flow.
- Be able to determine a QA and Testing strategy for the organization implementation and integration.
- Be able to run built-in automated tests on multiple environments and interpret results.
- Be able to benchmark joola and compare to previous rests.
- Be able to develop their own specific data accuracy tests needed for their organization.

### Audience
- QA and Testing staff
- Developers

### Setup
- Dedicated lab environment for the workshop [Lab #1, minimal setup](Lab-%231---Minimal-Setup)
- All attendants must have network access and credentials for the lab environment 
- The workshop space needs to have a projector
- Each attendant needs to laptop/workstation to be able to operate the lab
- This workshop is accompanied by an online presentation available @ TBC 

### Pre-requisite
- A good working understanding of QA principals and Manual/Automated Testing
- Familiarity with operating a linux OS is a plus
- Familiarity with node.js is a plus
- Familiarity with node.js' Mocha testing suite is a plus

### Schedule
- 09:00-09:15 - Gathering
- 09:15-10:00 - Understanding joola
- 10:00-10:30 - Built-in automated testing and benchmarks
- 10:30-12:30 - Hands-on experience with writing data accuracy tests

## The Workshop
The instructor will prepare the lab address on the screen to be available for guests arriving (Slide #2).

#### 09:00 - Gathering
During this period, while guests arrive, encourage them to try and connect to the lab and ensure there are no apparent network issues.
 
#### 09:15 - Understanding joola
During this section the instructor will take the class through the [[Introduction to joola]] presentation.
In addition, the class will review the specific implementation and integration of their organization.
- Class will login to the lab
- Class will start/stop/restart joola
- Class will be able to monitor logged activity and faults on joola
- Class will become familiar with their organization network-map (relating to joola)
- Class will be able to login into their organization joola nodes

#### 10:00 - Built-in automated testing and benchmarks
During this section the class will go over and understand the set of built-in automated scripts of the framework.
- Class will run built-in automated tests
- Class will be able to detect failed tests and offer basis analysis of cause

#### 10:30 - Hands-on experience with writing data accuracy tests
During this section the class will write their own set of data accuracy test scripts
- Class will create basic test scripts
- Class will write basic data accuracy tests
- Class will decide on a data flow process to examine and test it

## What's next?
Following the workshop, QA and Testing engineers would be able to write test units specific to their organization and needs.
