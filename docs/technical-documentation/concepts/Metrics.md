### Metrics: Measure data
Metrics are individual elements of a dimension that can be measured as a sum or a ratio. 
For example, the dimension City can be associated with a metric like Population, which would have a sum value of all the residents of the specific city.
Visits, Page per Visit, and Average Visit Duration are examples of metrics that may be part of joola.

### Relationship between dimensions and metrics
Although dimensions and metrics can stand alone, they usually are used in conjunction with one another. 
The values of dimensions and metrics and the relationships between those values is what creates meaning in your data. 
For the greatest insights, dimensions are often associated with one or more metric.

In this example, the City dimension can be associated with the metrics Population and Area. 
A ratio metric, like Population Density, could also be created with this data, giving even more insight about each of these cities:

|DIMENSION|METRIC|METRIC|
|---------|------|------|
|**City**|**Area (in sq. miles)**|**Population**|
|San Francisco|231|800,000|
|Berlin|334|3.5 million|
|Singapore|224|5.2 million|
