The minimal setup available is a single machine running joola, redis and mongo. It offers no availability, redundancy or scalability, but is ideal for development and testing purposes.  
 It's also useful for those not requiring system redundancy, for example: small in-house implementations.
 
## Deployment Script
As with all labs, we use Chef for managing deployment recipes and these are stored under a [dedicated repository][labs].
