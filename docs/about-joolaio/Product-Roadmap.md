## Overview

The current release of joola is **0.4.0**. The planned roadmap for joola is divided in two:

1. **Short term: a series of planned releases** - adding specific, mostly incremental features, tweaks and bug fixes to the core platform
2. **Longer term: an approximate schedule for new components and capabilities** - setting out priorities and approximate timings for all-new joola components and other ambitious new developments

We discuss each of these in turn below.

## Short-term: planned releases

In this section we list out the series of 'point' releases (0.x, 0.y etc) that we have planned. This list is accurate as of early December 2013 - but we always recommend browsing the list of [Open Milestones] [milestones] on our main GitHub repository.

**Warning:** we may change this schedule as new priorities are identified and the community feeds back on our current plans. If you are particularly interested in a given task being completed per schedule (or even accelerated), please 'vote' for the ticket by leaving a "+1" comment or similar on the relevant ticket.

The planned releases are as follows:

| Release   | Tickets                   | Objective(s)                                                                                           |
|-----------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **3.5**   | [See GitHub] [issues-0812] | Realtime analytics and complete the grid dispatch and hot swap caching                         			 |
| **3.6**   | [See GitHub] [issues-0813] | Add data source connectors and additional visualizations, UI features                         				 |
| **3.7**   | [See GitHub] [issues-0814] | New features 																																												 |

## Longer-term: approximate schedule

In this section we set out an approximate map of the new components and capabilities we want to add to joola, segmented by sub-system and by time (aka priority).

**Warning:** this schedule is approximate, and the items on it are subject to change. If you are interested in a specific functionality listed here, feel free to [Contact us](Talk-to-us) to find out more about its likely path-to-release.

The longer-term schedule of major developments is approximately as follows:
