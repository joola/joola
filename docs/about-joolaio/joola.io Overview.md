The open-source data visualization framework.

joola is a distributed data processing and visualization framework.
The framework is designed as an end-to-end solution for data analytics that lets you connect your databases by using a JSON based mapping of dimensions and metrics.
It exposes a RESTful API for querying the data, displaying and manipulating it.
The Client SDK communicates with the engine to display, visualize and provide insight into the data.
Developers can extend the framework in many ways, add data connectors, authentication plugins, visualizations and more.
