We want joola to be the best open-source data analytics framework that exist.
Already we have released 3 major versions, sold commercial licenses and built a small community around the framework.
We're now looking for companies to adopt joola and show their support of open-source data analytics.

### We need your help!

Your sponsorship will help us to be able to build out new features and refine existing ones.
Some of the things that we have planned for the future of the framework include:

- An even faster system
- Complete set of tests for functionality, UI and data accuracy
- D3 and additional charting providers
- Support additional authentication providers, such as : OpenID, GitHub, OAuth and more
- Self deployment of additioal nodes via integration with cloud providers
- Better headless integration
- More CI functionality
